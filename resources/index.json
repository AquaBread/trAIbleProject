Unlike quantum me-\nchanics or thermal physics (for example), there is a fairly general consensus with\nrespect to the teaching of electrodynamics; the subjects to be included, and even\ntheir order of presentation, are not particularly controversial, and textbooks differ\nmainly in style and tone. My approach is perhaps less formal than most; I think\nthis makes dif\ufb01cult ideas more interesting and accessible.\nFor this new edition I have made a large number of small changes, in the in-\nterests of clarity and grace.

Where is the force of impact between two colliding\nbilliard balls? The answer is that all these forces are electromagnetic. Indeed,\nit is scarcely an exaggeration to say that we live in an electromagnetic world\u2014\nvirtually every force we experience in everyday life, with the exception of gravity,\nis electromagnetic in origin.\nThe strong forces, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nu-\ncleus, have extremely short range, so we do not \u201cfeel\u201d them, in spite of the fact that\nthey are a hundred times more powerful than electrical forces. The weak forces,\nwhich account for certain kinds of radioactive decay, are also of short range, and\nthey are far weaker than electromagnetic forces.

So electrodynamics, a beautifully complete and successful theory, has be-\ncome a kind of paradigm for physicists: an ideal model that other theories emulate.\nThe laws of classical electrodynamics were discovered in bits and pieces by\nFranklin, Coulomb, Amp\u00e8re, Faraday, and others, but the person who completed\nthe job, and packaged it all in the compact and consistent form it has today, was\nJames Clerk Maxwell.

Off hand, you might expect a large current in the battery and\nnone at all in the lamp. Who\u2019s doing the pushing, in the rest of the circuit, and how\ndoes it happen that this push is exactly right to produce the same current in each\nsegment?

How do all the charges know to start moving at the same\ninstant?\nAnswer: If the current were not the same all the way around (for instance, dur-\ning the \ufb01rst split second after the switch is closed), then charge would be piling up\nsomewhere, and\u2014here\u2019s the crucial point\u2014the electric \ufb01eld of this accumulating\ncharge is in such a direction as to even out the \ufb02ow. Suppose, for instance, that\nthe current into the bend in Fig. 7.8 is greater than the current out. Then charge\npiles up at the \u201cknee,\u201d and this produces a \ufb01eld aiming away from the kink.3 This\n\ufb01eld opposes the current \ufb02owing in (slowing it down) and promotes the current\n\ufb02owing out (speeding it up) until these currents are equal, at which point there is\nno further accumulation of charge, and equilibrium is established. It\u2019s a beautiful\nsystem, automatically self-correcting to keep the current uniform, and it does it\nall so quickly that, in practice, you can safely assume the current is the same all\naround the circuit, even in systems that oscillate at radio frequencies.\nFIGURE 7.7\nIin\nIout\nE\nE\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nFIGURE 7.8\n3The amount of charge involved is surprisingly small\u2014see W.

In electrostatics and\nmagnetostatics the third law holds, but in electrodynamics it does not.\nWell, that\u2019s an interesting curiosity, but then, how often does one actually use\nthe third law, in practice? Answer: All the time! For the proof of conservation of\nmomentum rests on the cancellation of internal forces, which follows from the\nthird law. When you tamper with the third law, you are placing conservation of\nmomentum in jeopardy, and there is hardly any principle in physics more sacred\nthan that.\nMomentum conservation is rescued, in electrodynamics, by the realization\nthat the \ufb01elds themselves carry momentum.
