For information or to register for a class, visit the EHS website. \n\uf071 \nTraining is available for university employees through TrainTraq  \n \nFire Hydrants \n \nFire hydrants are located throughout the campus and play a vital role in fire suppression operations.  It is important to \nmaintain a clear path to all hydrants and allow clear distances around hydrants to allow uninhibited operation should \nan emergency occur.    It is also important that vehicles are not parked within 15 feet of fire hydrants or other fire safety \nequipment.  A minimum of six (6) feet shall be maintained around all fire hydrants.  \n \nFire Lanes  \n \nFire lanes are designated for emergency personnel and equipment.  Fire lanes provide clear vehicle access to buildings \nand allows responders to gain quick access to the building and/or fire protection systems.  Unattended parking in or \nblocking any fire lane is prohibited.   \n \nFire and Life Safety Inspections \n \nFire and life safety inspections are conducted at least annually in Texas A&M University facilities.  The goal of these \ninspections is to help identify potentially unsafe practices and conditions in Texas A&M University facilities.  These are \nnot surprise inspections.  EHS will notify the building proctor or facility coordinator prior to inspecting a facility.  We \nwant to work with building occupants to help ensure a fire safe environment in which to work.  \nSome of the items that our inspectors will be looking for include but are not limited to: \n"

The following sections discuss each type of fire suppression equipment.  \n \nSprinkler Systems  \n \nThe purpose of a water sprinkler system is to contain and to minimize the spread of a fire, but is often successful in \nextinguishing fires.  Sprinkler heads are normally activated by heat. Generally, if one is activated not all of the sprinklers \nin a building will discharge. Only in specialized sprinkler systems are they connected to smoke detectors or manual pull \nstations. \n \nTo ensure that sprinklers are effective in the event of a fire: \n\uf071 \nMaintaining a minimum of 18 inches of clearance below the sprinkler head is required to any equipment or \nstored items \n\uf071 \nDo not hang drapes, curtains, tarps, etc. that will interfere with the spray pattern of the sprinkler \n\uf071 \nNever attach or hang anything from sprinkler piping or sprinkler heads  \n\uf071 \nDo not paint or damage sprinkler heads in any manner \n \nGaseous/Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems \n \nSpecial work areas such as computer server rooms or bulk chemical storage rooms may contain specialized gaseous fire \nextinguishing systems such as carbon dioxide (CO2), FE 13, FM 200, or Halon 1301 in addition to water based fire \nsuppression systems.  These systems work by displacing the oxygen in the room to a level that will no longer support a \nfire.  To ensure that the system operates as designed, the area or room(s) protected must have its structural integrity \npreserved in order to maintain the required concentration level of the gas.  There should be no penetrations through \nwalls, ceilings, or floors and doors should be kept in the closed position.   \n \nOnce a system is activated, the low level of oxygen is also dangerous to humans. Caution should be used when working \nin areas where these oxygen-depriving extinguishing agents are used.  Manually operated systems, such as a pull-station \nor push button, should have signs posted indicating it will activate the agent. Do not enter a room that has discharged \nan oxygen-depriving agent until it has been ventilated and appropriate tests of the atmosphere have verified it is safe \nto enter. \n \nKitchen Hood Suppression Systems \n \nCommercial cooking operations as well as common kitchens in residence halls utilize automatic kitchen fire suppression \nsystems to control/extinguish cooking fires.  These systems are monitored by the fire detection and notification system. \nKitchen hood systems utilize both automatic as well as manual initiation via the activation of a pull station.   In addition, \ncode requires the installation of a Class K portable fire extinguisher within a specified distance to the kitchen hood \nsuppression systems.  Occupants should be aware of the operation of these systems and the use of the Class K \nextinguisher (see fire extinguishers) \n \nStandpipe and Hose Systems  \n \nA standpipe system is an arrangement of piping, valves, hose connections and allied equipment installed in a building \nor structure for the purpose of manually extinguishing a fire.  Fire hose cabinets are located in several buildings near \nor in the exit stairwells and in corridors.  The position of Texas A&M University is that employees should only attempt \nto extinguish a fire with a portable fire extinguisher.  Local fire department responders will use the standpipe system in \nthe event of a fire in a building.  Access to these systems should be maintained at all times and should not be blocked \nby any equipment, chairs, desks, etc. \n \nFire Watch  \n \nFire watches require the continuous patrol of all areas of the building affected by the impairment to look for evidence \nof smoke, fire, or any abnormal conditions.  As noted in its definition, if a life-threatening situation is discovered, the \nperson conducting the fire watch must immediately contact emergency personnel, alert the occupants (if applicable) to \nthe emergency and assist in their evacuation. \n \n \n \n"

Documents to be submitted to the AHJ for review. \nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) \n \nThe Texas Railroad Commission regulates the sale and use of LPG, including butane and propane.  In addition, the \nLiquefied Petroleum Gas Code (NFPA 58) provides regulations on the use of LPG as well.  These regulations govern \nseveral types of LPG-powered equipment and procedures including the following:  \n\uf071 \nForklifts  \n\uf071 \nFloor buffers  \n\uf071 \nCooking and heating equipment  \n\uf071 \nLaboratory equipment  \n \nExhaust fumes may contain carbon monoxide which can present a health hazard.  Exhaust can also create smoke which \nmay activate a smoke detector. Take special precautions to ensure adequate ventilation when using these machines \nindoors.  \n \nBecause LPG is extremely flammable, it is a potential fire hazard.  Do not store LPG near heat, flame, or other ignition \nsources.  In addition, do not leave portable LPG containers larger than 16 oz."
