Fire and life safety at Texas A&M University is governed by state and local standards \nincluding System Regulations, University Rules, and University Standard Administrative Procedures.  Ultimate \njurisdiction for fire safety lies with the Texas State Fire Marshal and with the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) \nas designated by the President of Texas A&M University.  By presidential designation, the Assistant Director for the \nFire and Life Safety Program in Environmental Health and Safety is designated to be the local AHJ and to be responsible \nfor the day to day fire prevention, inspections, and program oversight.  However, each and every individual, whether \nfaculty, staff, student, or visitor on our campus shares a role in fire safety.   \n \nProgram Basis  \n \nThe foundation for the fire and life safety program at Texas A&M University is provided by the following documents: \n\uf071 \nTexas A&M University System Policy 24.01 \u2013 Risk Management \n\uf071 \nTexas A&M University System Regulation 24.01.01 \u2013 Health and Safety \n\uf071 \nTexas A&M University System Regulation 24.01.04 \u2013 Fire and Life Safety   \n\uf071 \nTexas A&M University Rule 24.01.01.M4 \u2013 Environmental Health and Safety Program \n\uf071 \nTexas A&M University Rule 24.01.01.M7 \u2013 Fire and Life Safety Compliance  \n \nApplicable Codes & Standards \n \nThe Texas State Fire Marshal\u2019s Office has adopted the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1 \u2013 Fire Code and \nNFPA 101 - Life Safety Code\u00a9 and all referenced codes and standards as the primary guide for fire and life safety.  It is \nimportant to note that these codes are not all inclusive, are not building codes, and that other codes and standards may \nalso apply.  This list of additional codes and standards include, but are not limited to: \n\uf071 \nInternational Building Code \n\uf071 \nInternational Fire Code \n\uf071 \nInternational Mechanical Code \n\uf071 \nAmericans with Disabilities Act \n\uf071 \nTexas Accessibility Standards Act \n \nTexas A&M University adopts the most recent edition of all codes and standards.    \n \nFire and Life Safety Program Overview \n \nThe fire and life safety program at Texas A&M University involves numerous activities, programs, and procedures to \nhelp ensure that our campus is a safe place to work, live, and play.  These program areas include fire prevention, fire \nsuppression, emergency preparedness, preplanning, education, and response.  The following information is provided \nas a general guideline for activities associated with fire and life safety.

Items that require security may be placed in a locking file cabinet or desk drawer on the way out \n\uf071 \nFloor proctors should check all rooms and close doors on their way out \n\uf071 \nAll building occupants should gather in the preplanned meeting place \n\uf071 \nFloor proctors should take a \"head count\" to determine if all occupants have left the building \n\uf071 \nUpon completion of the drill, an evaluation of the drill shall be conducted and filed with EHS to identify any \nareas for improvement and to document the drill \n \nCandles & Incense \n \nThe use of candles, incense burners, oil lamps and other items are governed by university SAP 24.01.01.M7.02 \u2013 \nRestriction on Candles.    \n \nGeneral guidelines include: \n\uf071 \nCandles, incense burners, oil lamps or other personal items that have open flames or that smolder, are \nprohibited in work areas (individual or group), conference rooms, restrooms, etc. in all campus buildings, \nregardless of whether the item has been lit.  \n\uf071 \nCandles, flame effects, or pyrotechnics used for banquets, ceremonies, science demonstrations, theatrical \nproductions, indoor fireworks or other entertainment are addressed in a separate SAP 24.01.01.M7.01 \u2013 Use \nof Pyrotechnics, Flame Effects, or Laser Light Shows \n\uf071 \nThis use of candles does not apply to such devices used in the course and scope of University or Agency \nsponsored research or activities necessary to conduct business operations.   If the burning of a candle(s) is \npermitted under the above-mentioned exemption, the candle must be in a glass or similar container and kept \naway from combustible materials. \n \nStudents living in residence halls and University-owned apartments are governed by similar but separate rules \nadministered by the Department of Residence Life.  \n \nIn lieu of candles, listed (UL, FM, ETL) air fresheners and wax or potpourri warmers may be used.  \n \nCombustible Storage  \n \nOne of the most common violations of general fire safety practices is that of improper or excessive storage of \ncombustible material.  By storing excess combustible materials improperly, employees not only increase the potential \nfor having a fire but increase the potential severity of a fire.  To reduce the hazards associated with combustible storage, \nfollow these guidelines:  \n\uf071 \nEliminate excess combustible materials such as paper and cardboard \n\uf071 \nNever store combustible materials in hallways, stairwells, or mechanical/electrical rooms \n\uf071 \nWhen stacking combustible materials, leave at least 24\u201d from the top of the storage to the ceiling \n \n \n \n"

Only in specialized sprinkler systems are they connected to smoke detectors or manual pull \nstations. \n \nTo ensure that sprinklers are effective in the event of a fire: \n\uf071 \nMaintaining a minimum of 18 inches of clearance below the sprinkler head is required to any equipment or \nstored items \n\uf071 \nDo not hang drapes, curtains, tarps, etc. that will interfere with the spray pattern of the sprinkler \n\uf071 \nNever attach or hang anything from sprinkler piping or sprinkler heads  \n\uf071 \nDo not paint or damage sprinkler heads in any manner \n \nGaseous/Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems \n \nSpecial work areas such as computer server rooms or bulk chemical storage rooms may contain specialized gaseous fire \nextinguishing systems such as carbon dioxide (CO2), FE 13, FM 200, or Halon 1301 in addition to water based fire \nsuppression systems.  These systems work by displacing the oxygen in the room to a level that will no longer support a \nfire.  To ensure that the system operates as designed, the area or room(s) protected must have its structural integrity \npreserved in order to maintain the required concentration level of the gas.  There should be no penetrations through \nwalls, ceilings, or floors and doors should be kept in the closed position.   \n \nOnce a system is activated, the low level of oxygen is also dangerous to humans. Caution should be used when working \nin areas where these oxygen-depriving extinguishing agents are used.  Manually operated systems, such as a pull-station \nor push button, should have signs posted indicating it will activate the agent. Do not enter a room that has discharged \nan oxygen-depriving agent until it has been ventilated and appropriate tests of the atmosphere have verified it is safe \nto enter. \n \nKitchen Hood Suppression Systems \n \nCommercial cooking operations as well as common kitchens in residence halls utilize automatic kitchen fire suppression \nsystems to control/extinguish cooking fires.  These systems are monitored by the fire detection and notification system. \nKitchen hood systems utilize both automatic as well as manual initiation via the activation of a pull station.   In addition, \ncode requires the installation of a Class K portable fire extinguisher within a specified distance to the kitchen hood \nsuppression systems.  Occupants should be aware of the operation of these systems and the use of the Class K \nextinguisher (see fire extinguishers) \n \nStandpipe and Hose Systems  \n \nA standpipe system is an arrangement of piping, valves, hose connections and allied equipment installed in a building \nor structure for the purpose of manually extinguishing a fire.  Fire hose cabinets are located in several buildings near \nor in the exit stairwells and in corridors.  The position of Texas A&M University is that employees should only attempt \nto extinguish a fire with a portable fire extinguisher.  Local fire department responders will use the standpipe system in \nthe event of a fire in a building.  Access to these systems should be maintained at all times and should not be blocked \nby any equipment, chairs, desks, etc. \n \nFire Watch  \n \nFire watches require the continuous patrol of all areas of the building affected by the impairment to look for evidence \nof smoke, fire, or any abnormal conditions.  As noted in its definition, if a life-threatening situation is discovered, the \nperson conducting the fire watch must immediately contact emergency personnel, alert the occupants (if applicable) to \nthe emergency and assist in their evacuation. \n \n \n \n"

Hot Work \nprocedures must be followed to prevent the outbreak of fire, fire alarm activations, smoke, and odor migration in \nbuildings resulting from any temporary operation involving the use of open flames or which produces heat and/or \nsparks.  Hot work includes but is not limited to brazing, grinding, cutting, torch soldering, thawing pipes, torch applied \nroofing and welding. For general hot work use, an application must be submitted to EHS for review and issuance of a \npermit.  \n \nThis procedure applies to work performed by any Texas A&M University employee, student or contractor performing \nwork in existing buildings, new construction in existing buildings or new construction attached to existing buildings. \nWhen hot work is performed outdoors, necessary precautions should be taken to ensure combustible materials have \nbeen cleared and the risk of fire has been eliminated.  This procedure does not apply to new construction where there \nis no attachment to existing buildings or to areas that are specifically designed and equipped for such operations, i.e. \nmaintenance shop areas and designed welding areas.   \n \nProjects under the management of SSC EDCS will utilize the Hot Work process within e-Builder.   \n \nContractors with written safety programs and having a protocol for Hot Work that is equivalent to this program may \nutilize their program.   Documents to be submitted to the AHJ for review. \nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) \n \nThe Texas Railroad Commission regulates the sale and use of LPG, including butane and propane.  In addition, the \nLiquefied Petroleum Gas Code (NFPA 58) provides regulations on the use of LPG as well.  These regulations govern \nseveral types of LPG-powered equipment and procedures including the following:  \n\uf071 \nForklifts  \n\uf071 \nFloor buffers  \n\uf071 \nCooking and heating equipment  \n\uf071 \nLaboratory equipment  \n \nExhaust fumes may contain carbon monoxide which can present a health hazard.  Exhaust can also create smoke which \nmay activate a smoke detector. Take special precautions to ensure adequate ventilation when using these machines \nindoors.  \n \nBecause LPG is extremely flammable, it is a potential fire hazard.  Do not store LPG near heat, flame, or other ignition \nsources.  In addition, do not leave portable LPG containers larger than 16 oz."

Heat radiating \nfrom the unit can ignite clothing, papers and plastic near or beneath desks. The space heater must have a \nbuilt-in, automatic tip-over switch.  This safety feature automatically turns off the heating element if the \nheater is accidently tipped or falls over. \nFIRE PROTECTION EQUIPMENT \nFire alarm manual pull stations and fire extinguishers shall be easily visible and accessible at all \ntimes.   \nFile cabinets, desks, bookcases or decorations cannot block fire alarm pull stations or fire extinguishers.  \nPeople must be able to easily locate and activate pull stations to manually signal a fire alarm.

Combustible materials must be kept at a minimum \nin corridors.   \nThe less material that can burn in the hallway will ensure the safe evacuation of occupants using that hall to \nget out of the building.  Flat decorations are less flammable than 3-dimensional plastic, Styrofoam or cloth.   \nAn example of a wall section would be the wall area between two classroom doors.  Another would be the \nwall area between a hall corner and a doorway.  \nCombustible materials cannot be displayed on or within a 3-foot radius of classroom doors.    \nThe classroom door may be the only safe way to exit the room.  Just like corridors, eliminating materials \nthat can easily burn and block an exit will allow quick evacuation from the classroom.  Only fire evacuation \nplans, severe weather procedures or emergency kits can be near the classroom doors.  This practice only \napplies to classrooms that have doors.  Open-concept classrooms normally have 2-3 passageways out of the \nroom and are wider than 4 feet.   \nNo combustible materials can be attached to the ceiling and excessive combustibles cannot be \nsuspended from the ceiling.   \nCeiling materials are fire retardant and difficult to burn.  By putting materials that easily burn on a ceiling, \nfire can spread quickly throughout a room.  A large number of suspended items, based on their design, \nlocation as well as the size of the room, can block water from sprinkler heads trying to put out a fire.  If \nnear a classroom door, suspended items that catch on fire could block safe exit out of the room. \nA string of decorative, Christmas-style lights cannot be used more than 90 days.   \nThe safety tag on the string of lights specifically warns about this fire hazard.  The better alternative is light \nemitting diode (LED) rope lights.  LEDs create less heat, are enclosed in clear plastic and have a safe, 3-\nyear life span \n \n"

The text is an outgrowth of the new physics major curriculum developed by the Paradigms in \nPhysics program at Oregon State University. This new curriculum distributes material from the sub-\ndisciplines throughout the two upper-division years and provides students with a more gradual tran-\nsition between introductory and advanced levels. We have also incorporated and developed modern \npedagogical strategies to help improve student learning. This text covers the quantum mechanical \naspects of our curriculum in a way that can also be used in traditional curricula, but that still pre-\nserves the advantages of the Paradigms approach to the ordering of materials and the use of student \nengagement activities.\nPARADIGMS PROGRAM\nThe Paradigms project began in 1997, when the Department of Physics at Oregon State University \nbegan an extensive revision of the upper-division physics major. In an effort to encourage students \nto draw connections between the subdisciplines of physics, the structure of the Paradigms has been \ncrafted to mimic the organization of expert physics knowledge. Students are presented with a model \nof how physicists organize their understanding of physical phenomena and problem solving. Each \nof the nine short junior-year Paradigms courses focuses on a speci\ufb01c paradigm or class of physics \nproblems that serves as the centerpiece of the course and on which different tools and skills are built. \nIn the senior year, students resume a more traditional curriculum, taking six capstone courses in \nthe traditional disciplines. This curriculum incorporates a diverse set of student activities that allow \nstudents to stay actively engaged in the classroom and to work together in constructing their under-\nstanding of physics. Computer resources are used frequently to help students visualize the systems \nthey are studying.\nCONTENT AND APPROACH\nQuantum mechanics is integrated into four of the junior-year Paradigms courses and one senior-year \ncapstone course at Oregon State University. This text includes all the quantum mechanics topics \ncovered in those \ufb01ve courses. We adopt a \u201cspins-\ufb01rst\u201d approach by introducing quantum mechanics \nthrough the analysis of sequential Stern-Gerlach spin measurements. This approach is based upon \nprevious presentations of spin systems by Feynman, Leighton, and Sands; Cohen-Tannoudji, Diu, \nand Laloe; Sakurai; and Townsend. The aim of the spins-\ufb01rst approach is twofold: (1) To imme-\ndiately immerse students in the inherently quantum mechanical aspects of physics by focusing on \nsimple measurements that have no classical explanation, and (2) To give students early and extensive \nexperience with the mechanics of quantum mechanics in the forms of Dirac and matrix notation. \n"

            "Sentence": "xvi \nPreface \nThe  \nsimplicity of the spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems allows the students to focus on these new features, \nwhich run counter to classical mechanics.\nThe \ufb01rst three chapters of this text deal exclusively with spin systems and extensions to general \ntwo- and three-state quantum mechanical systems. The basic postulates of quantum mechanics are \nillustrated through their manifestation in the Stern-Gerlach experiments. After these three chapters, \nstudents have the tools to tackle any quantum mechanical problem presented in Dirac or matrix \nnotation. After a brief interlude into quantum spookiness (the EPR Paradox and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat) \nin Chapter 4, we tackle the traditional wave function aspects of quantum mechanics. We present \nseveral quantum systems\u2014a particle in a box, on a ring, on a sphere, the hydrogen atom, and the \nharmonic oscillator\u2014and emphasize their common features and their connections to the basic pos-\ntulates. The differential equations of angular momentum and the hydrogen atom radial problem are \nsolved in detail to expose students to the rigor of series solutions, though we stress that these are \nagain eigenvalue equations, no different in principle from the spin eigenvalue equations. Whenever \npossible, we continue the use of Dirac notation and matrix notation learned in the spin chapters, \nemphasizing the importance of \ufb02uency in multiple representations. We build upon the spins-\ufb01rst \napproach by using the spin-1/2 example to introduce perturbation theory, the addition of angular \nmomentum, and identical particles.\nUSAGE\nAt Oregon State University, the content of this text is taught in \ufb01ve courses as shown below.\nJunior-Year Paradigms Courses\nSpin and Quantum \nMeasurement\nWaves\nCentral Forces\nPeriod Systems\n1."

No other upper-level physics or mathematics courses \nare required. For our own students, we review matrix algebra in a seven contact hour \u201cpreface\u201d course \nthat precedes the Paradigms courses that teach quantum mechanics. The material for that preface course \nis in Appendix C. The material in Appendix B summarizes an earlier Paradigms course on oscillations, \nand the material in Appendix D summarizes the classical wave part of the Paradigms course on waves.\nSTUDENT ACTIVITIES AND WEBSITE\nStudent engagement activities are an integral part of the Paradigms curriculum. All of the activities \nthat we have developed are freely available on our wiki website:\nhttp://physics.oregonstate.edu/portfolioswiki\nThe wiki contains a wealth of information about the Paradigms project, the courses we teach, and the \nmaterials we have developed. Details about individual activities include descriptions, student handouts, \ninstructor\u2019s guides, advice about how to use active engagement strategies, videos of classroom prac-\ntice, narratives of classroom activities, and comments from users\u2014both internal and external to Oregon \nState University. This is a dynamic website that is continually updated as we develop new activities and \nimprove existing ones. We encourage you to visit the website and join the community. E-mail us with \ncorrections, additions, and suggestions.\nEach of the quantum mechanics activities that we use in our \ufb01ve courses is referenced in the \nresource section at the end of the appropriate chapter in the text. The quantum mechanics activities are \ncollected within the wiki website with a direct link: \nwww.physics.oregonstate.edu/qmactivities \nThese activities include different types of activities such as computer-based activities, group activities, \nand class response activities. The most extensive activity is a computer simulation of Stern-Gerlach \nexperiments. This SPINS software is a full-featured, menu-driven application that allows students to \nsimulate successive Stern-Gerlach measurements and explore incompatible observables, eigenstate \nexpansions, interference, and quantum dynamics. The use of the SPINS software facilitates our spins-\n\ufb01rst approach. The beauty of the simulation is that students steeped in classical physics perform a foun-\ndational quantum experiment and learn the most fascinating and counterintuitive aspects of quantum \nmechanics at an early stage.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is the product of a broad and energetic community of educators and students within the \nParadigms in Physics program. I thank all of our students for their hard work, insights, and innu-\nmerable suggestions. My colleagues Corinne Manogue and Janet Tate have developed some of the \ncourses upon which this text is based. They have worked with me throughout the writing of this text \nand I am indebted to them for their valuable contributions.

As the wind and rain lashed at the window, he feared having to retreat to the storm cellar \nonce again. The residents of Erwin\u2019s apartment building sought shelter whenever there were threats of \ntornadoes in the area. While it was safe down there, Erwin feared the ridicule he would face once again \nfrom the other school boys. In the rush to the cellar, Erwin seemed to always end up with a random \npair of socks, and the other boys teased him about it mercilessly.\nNot that Erwin hadn\u2019t tried hard to solve this problem. He had a very simple collection of \nsocks\u2014black or white, for either school or play; short or long, for either trousers or lederhosen. \nAfter the \ufb01rst few teasing episodes from the other boys, Erwin had sorted his socks into two sepa-\nrate drawers. He placed all the black socks in one drawer and all the white socks in another drawer. \nErwin \ufb01gured he could determine an individual sock\u2019s length in the dark of night simply by feel-\ning it, but he had to have them presorted into white and black because the apartment generally lost \npower before the call to the shelter.\nUnfortunately, Erwin found that this presorting of the socks by color was ineffective. Whenever \nhe reached into the white sock drawer and chose two long socks, or two short socks, there was a 50% \nprobability of any one sock being black or white. The results from the black sock drawer were the \nsame. The socks seemed to have \u201cforgotten\u201d the color that Erwin had determined previously.\nErwin also tried sorting the socks into two drawers based upon their length, without regard to \ncolor. When he chose black or white socks from these long and short drawers, the socks had also \u201cfor-\ngotten\u201d whether they were long or short.\nAfter these fruitless attempts to solve his problem through experiments, Erwin decided to save \nhimself the fashion embarrassment, and he replaced his sock collection with a set of medium length \nbrown socks. However, he continued to ponder the mysteries of the socks throughout his childhood.\nAfter many years of daydreaming about the mystery socks, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger proposed his the-\nory of \u201cQuantum Socks\u201d and become famous. And that is the beginning of the story of the quantum \nsocks.\nThe End.\nFarfetched??"

The Stern-Gerlach experiment demonstrated that measurements on microscopic \nor quantum particles are not always as certain as we might expect. Quantum particles behave as mys-\nteriously as Erwin\u2019s socks\u2014sometimes forgetting what we have already measured. Erwin\u2019s adven-\nture with the mystery socks is farfetched because you know that everyday objects do not behave like \nhis socks. If you observe a sock to be black, it remains black no matter what other properties of the \nsock you observe. However, the Stern- \nGerlach experiment goes against these ideas. Microscopic or \nquantum particles do not behave like the classical objects of your everyday experience. The act of \nobserving a quantum particle affects its measurable properties in a way that is foreign to our classical \nexperience.\nIn these \ufb01rst three chapters, we focus on the Stern-Gerlach experiment because it is a conceptu-\nally simple experiment that demonstrates many basic principles of quantum mechanics. We discuss \na variety of experimental results and the quantum theory that has been developed to predict those \nresults. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is based upon six postulates that we will \nintroduce as we develop the theoretical framework. (A complete list of these postulates is in Section 1.5.) \nWe use the Stern-Gerlach experiment to learn about quantum mechanics theory for two primary reasons: \n(1) It demonstrates how quantum mechanics works in principle by illustrating the postulates of quan-\ntum mechanics, and (2) it demonstrates how quantum mechanics works in practice through the use \nof Dirac notation and matrix mechanics to solve problems. By using a simple example, we can focus \non the principles and the new mathematics, rather than having the complexity of the physics obscure \nthese new aspects.\n1.1 \u0002 STERN-GERLACH EXPERIMENT\nIn 1922 Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach performed a seminal experiment in the history of quantum \nmechanics. In its simplest form, the experiment consisted of an oven that produced a beam of neu-\ntral atoms, a region of space with an inhomogeneous magnetic \ufb01eld, and a detector for the atoms, as \ndepicted in Fig. 1.1. Stern and Gerlach used a beam of silver atoms and found that the beam was split \ninto two in its passage through the magnetic \ufb01eld. One beam was de\ufb02ected upwards and one down-\nwards in relation to the direction of the magnetic \ufb01eld gradient.\nTo understand why this result is so at odds with our classical expectations, we must \ufb01rst analyze \nthe experiment classically. The results of the experiment suggest an interaction between a neutral parti-\ncle and a magnetic \ufb01eld. We expect such an interaction if the particle possesses a magnetic moment M.\nThe potential energy of this interaction is E = -M~B, which results in a force F = \u00021M~B2."

We assume that if no subscript is present on the quantum ket 1e.g., 0  +92, then the \nspin component is along the z-axis. This use of the z-axis as the default is a common convention \nthroughout our work and also in much of physics.\nA few items are noteworthy about this experiment. First, we notice that there are still only two \npossible outputs of the second Stern-Gerlach analyzer. The fact that it is aligned along a different axis \ndoesn\u2019t affect the fact that we get only two possible results for the case of a spin-1/2 particle. Second, \nit turns out that the results of this experiment would be unchanged if we used the lower port of the \ufb01rst \nanalyzer. That is, atoms entering the second analyzer in state 0  -9 would also result in half the atoms \nin each of the 0 {9x output ports.

This can be demonstrated in actual experiments by recording the \nindividual counts out of each port. The arrival sequences at any counter are completely random. We \ncan say only that there is a 50% probability that an atom from the second analyzer will exit the upper \nanalyzer port and a 50% probability that it will exit the lower port. The random arrival of atoms at the \ndetectors can be seen clearly in the SPINS program simulations.\nThis probabilistic nature is at the heart of quantum mechanics. One might be tempted to say that \nwe just don\u2019t know enough about the system to predict which port the atom will exit. That is to say, \nthere may be some other variables, of which we are ignorant, that would allow us to predict the results. \nSuch a viewpoint is known as a local hidden variable theory. John Bell proved that such theories are \nnot compatible with the experimental results of quantum mechanics. The conclusion to draw from this \nis that even though quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory, it is a complete description of reality. \nWe will have more to say about this in Chapter 4.\nNote that the 50% probability referred to above is the probability that an atom input to the second \nanalyzer exits one particular output port. It is not the probability for an atom to pass through the whole sys-\ntem of Stern-Gerlach analyzers.

Thus the last two analyzers behave like the two analyzers of Experiment 2 (except \nwith the order reversed), and the fact that there was an initial measurement that yielded Sz = +U>2 is \nsomehow forgotten or erased.\nThis result demonstrates another key feature of quantum mechanics: a measurement disturbs the \nsystem. The second analyzer has disturbed the system such that the spin component along the z-axis \ndoes not have a unique value, even though we measured it with the \ufb01rst analyzer.

However, \nthe analogy we want to make with these spatial vectors is only mathematical, not physical. The spatial \nunit vectors have three important mathematical properties that are characteristic of a basis: the basis \nvectors i\nn \n, j\nn \n, and k\nn are normalized, orthogonal, and complete. Spatial vectors are normalized if their \nmagnitudes are unity, and they are orthogonal if they are geometrically perpendicular to each other. \nThe basis is complete if any general vector in the space can be written as a linear superposition of the \nbasis vectors. These properties of spatial basis vectors can be summarized as follows:\n \n \ni\nn~i\nn = j\nn~j\nn = k\nn~k\nn = 1   normalization\n \n \ni\nn~j\nn = i\nn~k\nn = j\nn~k\nn = 0   orthogonality  \n(1.9)\n \n \nA = axi\nn + ay j\nn + azk\nn   completeness,\nwhere A is a general vector.

For example, the experiment shown in Fig. 1.8 has the state 0  c9 = 0  +9 prepared by the \n\ufb01rst Stern-Gerlach device and then input to the second Stern-Gerlach device aligned along the z-axis. \nTherefore the probabilities of measuring the input state 0  c9 = 0  +9 to have the two output values are \nas shown. Because the spin-1/2 system has only two possible measurement results, these two prob-\nabilities must sum to unity\u2014there is a 100% probability of recording some value in the experiment. \nThis basic rule of probabilities is why the rules of quantum mechanics require that all state vectors \nbe properly normalized before they are used in any calculation of probabilities. The experimental \npredictions shown in Fig. 1.8 are an example of the fourth postulate of quantum mechanics, which is \npresented below.\n50\n0\nP\u0002\u0005\u0006\u0005\u0002\u0004\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0003\u00022 \u0006\u00051\nP\u0003\u0005\u0006\u0005\u0002\u0004\u0003\u0002\u0002\u0003\u00022 \u0006\u00050\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\u0002\u0003\n\u0002\u0002\u0003\n\u0002\u0003\u0003\nFIGURE 1.8 Probabilities of spin component measurements.\nPostulate 4 (Spin-1/2 system)\nThe probability of obtaining the value {U>2 in a measurement of the observ-\nable Sz on a system in the state 0  c9 is\nP{ = 08{ 0  c9 0\n2,\nwhere 0 {9 is the basis ket of Sz corresponding to the result {U>2.\nThis is labeled as the fourth postulate because we have written this postulate using the language of the \nspin-1/2 system, while the general statement of the fourth postulate presented in Section 1.5 requires \nthe second and third postulates of Section 2.1. A general spin component measurement is shown in \nFig. 1.9, along with a histogram that compactly summarizes the measurement results.\nBecause the quantum mechanical probability is found by squaring an inner product, we refer to \nan inner product, 8+ 0  c9 for example, as a probability amplitude or sometimes just an amplitude; \nmuch like a classical wave intensity is found by squaring the wave amplitude. Note that the conven-\ntion is to put the input or initial state on the right and the output or \ufb01nal state on the left: 8out0 in9, so \none would read from right to left in describing a problem. Because the probability involves the com-\nplex square of the amplitude, and 8out0 in9 = 8in0 out9*, this convention is not critical for calculat-\ning probabilities. Nonetheless, it is the accepted practice and is important in situations where several \namplitudes are combined.\nArmed with these new quantum mechanical rules and tools, let\u2019s continue to analyze the experi-\nments discussed earlier. Using the experimental results and the new rules we have introduced, we can \nlearn more about the mathematical behavior of the kets and the relationships among them.

The Stern-Gerlach experiments demonstrated that spin component measurements along the \nx-, y-, or z-axes yield only {U>2 as possible results. We learned how to predict the probabilities of \nthese measurements using the basis kets of the spin component observables Sx, Sy, and Sz, and these \npredictions agreed with the experiments. However, the real power of a theory is its ability to predict \nresults of experiments that you haven\u2019t yet done. For example, what are the possible results of a mea-\nsurement of the spin component Sn along an arbitrary direction n\nn and what are the predicted probabili-\nties?

We said that \nthe state vector represents all the information we can know about the system and we used the state \nvectors to calculate probabilities. With each observable Sx, Sy, and Sz we associated a pair of kets \n \ncorresponding to the possible measurement results of that observable.

In 1930, the neutrino was pos-\ntulated by Wolfgang Pauli as a solution to the beta decay problem. A free neutron decays to a proton \nand an electron with a lifetime of about 10 minutes in the most basic beta decay process. However, the \ndecay scheme n S p + e- violates conservation of angular momentum, and experimental data sug-\ngest that conservation of energy is also violated. That\u2019s not good. Rather than reject these two basic \nconservation laws, as some suggested, Pauli proposed that a third particle is involved in the decay \nprocess. Enrico Fermi named this new particle the \u201cneutrino.\u201d Fermi developed a theory that used the \nneutrino to properly explain beta decay, but it was 25 more years before a neutrino was detected.\nNeutrinos are uncharged, relativistic particles. In nuclear beta decay, neutrinos are produced in \nprocesses such as\n \nn S p + e- + ne  \n \np S n + e+ + ne, \n \n(3.68)\nwhere the subscript labels the neutrino ne as an electron neutrino and the bar labels ne as an antineu-\ntrino. In the standard model of particle physics, neutrinos are massless, like photons. Neutrinos are so \nelusive because they interact via the weak force or weak interaction, which is the weakest of the four \nfundamental forces\u2014the strong nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravity being the other three.\nThe reaction p S n + e+ + ne is part of the thermonuclear reaction chain in the sun and other \nstars, so we earthlings are constantly bombarded with neutrinos along with the essential photons we \nreceive from the sun. In the 1960s and 70s, landmark experiments indicated that there are only about \nhalf as many solar neutrinos arriving on earth as we would expect, given reliable models of stellar ther-\nmonuclear reactions. This solar neutrino problem has recently been solved by experiments detecting \nneutrinos from the sun and from nuclear reactors that demonstrate that neutrinos have nonzero mass. \nThese results are counter to the standard model and so have profound implications for particle physics \nand cosmology. Understanding how these experiments provide information on the neutrino mass is a \npowerful illustration of the applicability of Rabi\u2019s formula to other two-state systems.\nIn addition to the electron neutrinos in Eq. (3.68), there are other types of neutrinos associated \nwith other reactions, such as\n \n \np+ S m+ + nm\n \n \n \nm- S e- + nm + ne, \n \n(3.69)\nwhich represent the decay of a pion (p) to a muon (m) and the decay of a muon to an electron, respectively. \nA muon behaves exactly like an electron but has a larger mass. Electrons, muons, and a third particle \n(tau) and their associated neutrinos are collectively called leptons. In reactions involving these particles \n"

However, when neutrinos propagate in \nfree space, the weak interaction is not relevant and the only Hamiltonian of relevance is that due to the \nrelativistic energy of the particles, which includes their rest masses and momenta. The eigenstates of this \nHamiltonian are generally referred to as the mass eigenstates. If the masses of the two types of neutrinos \n(electron and muon) are different, then, in general, the mass eigenstates do not coincide with the weak \ninteraction eigenstates. This distinction between sets of eigenstates allows for \ufb02avor-changing processes.\nTo see why this is so, let the mass eigenstates be labeled 0 n19 and 0 n29. Either one of the two bases \n(mass or weak eigenstates) can be used as a complete basis upon which to expand any general state in \nthis system. Let\u2019s assume that the relation between the bases is\n \n 0 ne9 = cos u\n2\n 0 n19 + sin u\n2\n 0 n29  \n \n 0 nm9 = sin u\n2\n 0 n19 - cos u\n2\n 0 n29. \n \n(3.71)\nThe angle u>2 is generally referred to as the mixing angle (some treatments drop the factor 1/2, but \nwe retain it to be consistent with the previous spin-1/2 discussion)."

The Larmor frequency \ndepends on the magnetic \ufb01eld magnitude at the location of the particular nucleus being studied. This \nmagnetic \ufb01eld includes the applied external \ufb01eld and any internal \ufb01elds created by the local environ-\nment, such that measuring the resonance frequency provides valuable information about the environ-\nment of the nucleus.

The probabilistic \nnature of quantum mechanics does not agree with the certainty of the classical world\u2014we have no \ndoubt that the sun will rise tomorrow. Moreover, the disturbance of a quantum mechanical system \nthrough the action of measurement makes us part of the system, rather than an independent observer. \nThese issues and others make us wonder what is really going on in the quantum world. As quantum \nmechanics was being developed in the early twentieth century, many of the world\u2019s greatest physicists \ndebated the \u201ctrue meaning\u201d of quantum mechanics. They often developed gedanken experiments or \nthought experiments to illustrate their ideas. Some of these gedanken experiments have now actually \nbeen performed and some are still being pursued.\nIn this chapter, we present a few of the gedanken and real experiments that demonstrate the \nspookiness of quantum mechanics. We present enough details to give a \ufb02avor of the spookiness and \nprovide references for further readings on these topics at the end of the chapter.\n4.1 \u0002  \nEINSTEIN-PODOLSKY-ROSEN PARADOX\nAlbert Einstein was never comfortable with quantum mechanics. He is famously quoted as saying \n\u201cGott w\u00fcrfelt nicht\u201d or \u201cGod does not play dice,\u201d to express his displeasure with the probabilistic \nnature of quantum mechanics. But his opposition to quantum mechanics ran deeper than that. He felt \nthat properties of physical objects have an objective reality independent of their measurement, much \nas Erwin felt that his socks were black or white, or long or short, independent of his pulling them out \nof the drawer. In quantum mechanics, we cannot say that a particle whose spin is measured to be up \nhad that property before the measurement. It may well have been in a superposition state. Moreover, \nwe can only know one spin component of a particle, because measurement of one component disturbs \nour knowledge of the other components. Because of these apparent de\ufb01ciencies, Einstein believed that \nquantum mechanics was an incomplete description of reality.\nIn 1935, Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen published a paper presenting a gedan-\nken experiment designed to expose the shortcomings of quantum mechanics. The EPR Paradox \n(Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) tries to paint quantum mechanics into a corner and expose the \u201cabsurd\u201d \nbehavior of the theory. The essence of the argument is that if you believe that measurements on two \nwidely separated particles cannot in\ufb02uence each other, then the quantum mechanics of an ingeniously \nprepared two-particle system leads you to conclude that the physical properties of each particle are \nreally there\u2014they are elements of reality in the authors\u2019 words.\n"

Because the particles are widely separated, this element of reality must be independent \nof what observer A does, and hence, must have existed all along. The independence of the elements of \nreality of the two  \nparticles is called Einstein\u2019s locality principle, and is a fundamental assumption of \nthe EPR argument.\nThe correlation of spin measurements of the two observers is independent of the choice of mea-\nsurement direction, assuming the same direction for both observers. That is, if observer A measures \nthe x-component of spin and records S1x = +U>2, then we know with 100% certainty that observer B \nwill measure S2x = -U>2. Observer A is free to choose to measure S1x, S1y, or S1z, so EPR argue that \nS2x, S2y, and S2z must all be elements of reality for particle 2. However, quantum mechanics maintains \nthat we can know only one spin component at a time for a single particle. EPR conclude that quantum \nmechanics is an incomplete description of physical reality because it does not describe all the elements \nof reality of the particle.\nIf the EPR argument is correct, then the elements of reality, which are also called hidden vari-\nables or instruction sets, are really there, but for some reason we cannot know all of them at once. \nThus, one can imagine constructing a local hidden variable theory wherein there are different types of \nparticles with different instruction sets that determine the results of measurements. The theory is local \nbecause the instruction sets are local to each particle so that measurements by the two observers are \nindependent. The populations or probabilities of the different instruction sets can be properly adjusted \nin a local hidden variable theory to produce results consistent with quantum mechanics. Because quan-\ntum mechanics and a local hidden variable theory cannot be distinguished by experiment, the question \nof which is correct is then left to the realm of metaphysics. For many years, this was what many physi-\ncists believed. After all, it doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to believe that there are things we cannot know!\nHowever, in 1964, John Bell showed that the hidden variables that we cannot know cannot even \nbe there! Bell showed that there are speci\ufb01c measurements that can be made to distinguish between a \nlocal hidden variable theory and quantum mechanics. The results of these quantum mechanics experi-\nments are not compatible with any local hidden variable theory. Bell derived a very general relation, \nbut we present a speci\ufb01c one here for simplicity.\nBell\u2019s argument relies on observers A and B making measurements along a set of different direc-\ntions. Consider three directions a\nn, b\nn, c\nn in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.2, each 120\u00b0 from any of the other \ntwo. Each observer makes measurements of the spin projection along one of these three directions, \nchosen randomly. Any single observer\u2019s result can be only spin up or spin down along that direction, \nbut we record the results independent of the direction of the Stern-Gerlach analyzers, so we denote \none observer\u2019s result simply as  \n+ or  \n-, without noting the axis of measurement.

The components are assembled such that when the \nnucleus decays, it triggers the Geiger counter, which causes the hammer to break the bottle and release \nthe poisonous gas, killing the cat. Thus, after one hour there is a 50% probability that the cat is dead.\nAfter the one hour, the nucleus is in an equal superposition of undecayed and decayed states:\n \n0 cnucleus9 =\n1\n12 10 cundecayed9 + 0\n cdecayed92. \n(4.12)\nThe apparatus is designed such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the undecayed \nnuclear state and the live-cat state and a one-to-one correspondence between the decayed nuclear state \nand the dead-cat state.

However, quantum mechanics would lead us to \nbelieve that the cat was neither dead nor alive before we opened the box, but rather was in a super-\nposition of states, and the quantum state collapses to the alive state 0 calive9 or dead state 0 cdead9 only \nwhen we open the box and make the measurement by observing the cat. But our classical experiences \nclearly run counter to this. We would say that the cat really was dead or alive, we just did not know \nit yet. (Imagine that the cat is wearing a cyanide sensitive watch\u2014the time will tell us when the cat \nwas killed, if it is dead!)\nWhy are we so troubled by a cat in a superposition state? After all, we have just \ufb01nished three \nchapters of electrons in superposition states! What is so inherently different about cats and electrons? \nExperiment 4 that we studied in Chapters 1 and 2 provides a clue. The superposition state in that \nexperiment exhibits a clear interference effect that relies on the coherent phase relationship between \nthe two parts of the superposition state vector for the spin-1/2 particle. No one has ever observed such \nan interference effect with cats, so our gut feeling that cats and electrons are different appears justi\ufb01ed.\nThe main issues raised by the Schr\u00f6dinger cat gedanken experiment are (1) Can we describe mac-\nroscopic states quantum mechanically? and (2) What causes the collapse of the wave function?\nThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics championed by Bohr and Heisenberg \nmaintains that there is a boundary between the classical and quantum worlds. We describe micro-\nscopic systems (the nucleus) with quantum states and macroscopic systems (the cat, or even the Gei-\nger counter) with classical rules. The measurement apparatus causes the quantum state to collapse and \nto produce the single classical or meter result. The actual mechanism for the collapse of the wave func-\ntion is not speci\ufb01ed in the Copenhagen interpretation, and where to draw the line between the classical \nand the quantum world is not clear. Others have argued that the human consciousness is responsible \nfor collapsing the wave function, while some have argued that there is no collapse, just bifurcation into \nalternate, independent universes. Many of these different points of view are untestable experimentally \nand thus raise more metaphysical than physical questions.\nThese debates about the interpretation of quantum mechanics arise when we use words, which \nare based on our classical experiences, to describe the quantum world.

With a \ufb01rm foundation in how quantum mechanics works, we are ready to address the \ncentral question that quantum mechanics was designed to answer: How do we explain the structure of \nthe microscopic world? All around us are nuclei, atoms, molecules, and solids with unique properties \nthat cannot be explained with classical physics but require quantum mechanics. For example, quantum \nmechanics can tell us why sodium lamps are yellow, why laser diodes have a unique color, and why \nuranium is radioactive.\nThe key to understanding the structure of microscopic systems lies in the energy states that the \nsystems are allowed to have. Each microscopic system has a unique set of energy levels that gives that \nsystem a \u201c\ufb01ngerprint\u201d that sets it apart from other systems. With the tools of quantum mechanics, we \ncan build a theoretical model for the system, predict that \ufb01ngerprint, and compare it to the experimen-\ntal measurement. Our goal in this chapter and the ones that follow is to learn how to predict this energy \n\ufb01ngerprint. In this chapter we will study a particularly simple model system that exhibits most of the \nimportant features that are shared by all microscopic systems.\n5.1 \u0002 SPECTROSCOPY\nThe energy \ufb01ngerprint of a system not only identi\ufb01es that system uniquely, but the allowed energies \ndetermine the time evolution of the system through the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, as we learned in Chapter 3. \nOne of the primary experimental techniques for measuring the energy \ufb01ngerprint of a system is spectros-\ncopy. We saw a hint of this in the magnetic resonance example of Section 3.4: absorption and emission of \nphotons causes transitions between quantized energy levels of the system only when the photon energy \nmatches the spacing between the energy eigenstates. Historically, the spectrum of hydrogen was a key \ningredient in the development of quantum mechanics, and spectroscopy continues to play an important \nrole in characterizing new quantum systems and in verifying the rules of quantum mechanics.\nIn the magnetic resonance example of Section 3.4, the two quantized energy levels arose from the \ntwo possible spin components (up or down) and their different interactions with an applied magnetic \n\ufb01eld. The more common situation that gives rise to quantized energy levels is where two or more \nparticles interact in a way that limits their spatial motion and binds them together into a compos-\nite system. Bound systems such as nuclei, atoms, molecules, and solids are everyday examples that \nare characterized by distinct spectral lines associated with quantized energy states, (i.e., eigenstates \nof the Hamiltonian with discrete energy eigenvalues)."

This includes potential wells where the energy is larger than the well depth and cases where \nthe potential has no localized minimum.

As hard as \nyou might try, you cannot measure, and therefore cannot know, which slit the \u201cparticle\u201d goes through \nwithout disturbing it just a little bit. The simplest way to measure which slit the particle goes through \nis to watch, but you need some light to watch. If you see the particle, then at least one photon must \nhave scattered from the particle toward your eye, and the change in momentum of that photon in the \nscattering process will (through conservation of momentum) impart an equal and opposite change to \nthe particle\u2019s momentum. This change is enough to alter the phase of the particle\u2019s wave function and \ndestroy the interference fringes. In the early days of quantum mechanics, such \u201cwhich path\u201d experi-\nments were merely \u201cthought\u201d experiments or gedanken experiments because they were too hard to \nperform. However, in recent years careful experiments have demonstrated these effects beyond doubt.\nOne of the important features of an atom interferometer is its ability to measure extremely small \nchanges in potential energy. This ability arises from the dependence of the de Broglie wavelength of \nthe particle on the potential energy. If the potential energy varies, then the kinetic energy and hence the \nmomentum varies because the energy is conserved. The de Broglie wavelength depends on the particle \nmomentum, so a varying potential gives rises to a varying wavelength\n \n \nldB = h\np\n \n \n =\nh\n22m1E - V2\n ."

The goal of this chapter is to simplify \nboth these aspects of the problem. Analogous to the approach taken in classical mechanics, we reduce \nthe two-body problem to a \ufb01ctitious one-body problem and we separate the three spatial degrees of \nfreedom in a way that each spherical coordinate can be treated independently. A \ufb02owchart depicting \nthese two simpli\ufb01cations is shown in Fig. 7.2. In this chapter, we perform all the steps of Fig. 7.2 except \nthe radial coordinate part. In particular, we focus on the two angular degrees of freedom because they \nrelate to the angular momentum, which is a conserved quantity. In the next chapter, we solve the radial \naspect of the problem for a 1>r Coulomb potential energy, which leads to the quantized energy levels \nof the hydrogen atom. The journey through the next two chapters requires some mathematics that may \nappear daunting; we provide the roadmaps in Figs. 7.2 and 7.6 so you can see the forest for the trees.\n"

We arrive at the solution by de\ufb01ning some new quantities that \nyou would not imagine would be useful and by using minimal information about what how the opera-\ntors x\nn and p\nn behave. This operator method is also useful in describing angular momentum, and it is the \nbasis of quantum \ufb01eld theory.\nTo make this discussion of the operator solution to the harmonic oscillator problem clearer, let\u2019s \ngo ahead and present the energy spectrum answer to the problem. As we discussed in Chapter 5, the \nsolutions to bound state problems in different quantum mechanical systems share many features. The \nbound states in a potential energy well are discrete, with the ground state near, but not at, the bottom \nof the well. The positions of the energy levels depend upon the shape of the well. In the case of the \nin\ufb01nite square well that we studied in Chapter 5, the energy levels scale with n2, where n is the quan-\ntum number labeling the energy levels n = 1, 2, 3, ..."

However, we found a matrix representation to \nbe useful previously, for example in the discussion of spin states. Can we use a matrix representation \nfor the harmonic oscillator case? It turns out that we can. A matrix representation is a collection of \nnumbers that represents states and operators in terms of a chosen basis set. So we must \ufb01rst choose \na basis for the matrix representation. We have just solved for the energy basis states of the harmonic \noscillator, so that choice seems reasonable, especially in light of the importance of the energy basis in \nthe Schr\u00f6dinger time evolution recipe. So how do we \ufb01nd the numbers we need to represent states and \noperators as matrices in the energy representation? We do it by inspection!\nWe learned in Section 2.1 that an operator is always diagonal in its own basis, and eigenvec-\ntors are unit vectors in their own basis. So the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the energy basis and the \nenergy eigenstates are unit vectors in the energy basis. The diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian \nare the energy eigenvalues, so by inspection of our energy result in Eq.

Unfortunately, those problems represent a small fraction of the realistic problems that \nnature presents to us, and in most cases those exactly solvable problems are only approximations to \nreal problems. Now we must learn to solve more realistic problems that do not admit exact solutions. \nThe approach we take to solving these realistic problems is to make them look like problems we have \nalready solved exactly, with an additional part that represents the new, more realistic aspect of the \nproblem. We assume that this new part, the perturbation, is small so that we can use approximations \nto \ufb01nd the corrections to the exact solutions. Our focus is to discover how energies and eigenstates are \naffected by small additional terms in the Hamiltonian. To guide us, we will take some exactly solv-\nable problems, solve them, and then expand the solutions. We will compare these results with the new \nperturbation methods that we learn.\nWe had a sneak peek at how a perturbation affects a system in Chapter 5 when we studied the \nasymmetric square well. We saw that an additional potential energy \u201cshelf\u201d in the in\ufb01nite square well \nchanged the energy levels, as shown in Fig. 10.1. For small values V0 of the potential energy shelf, \nthe energy of the ground state is shifted by an amount that is linearly dependent on V0, but as the \nperturbation increases, the energy begins to change quadratically. This linear-to-quadratic behavior \nis a common feature of perturbation theory and will be evident as we proceed. Our goal is to produce \nplots like Fig. 10.1(b) that demonstrate how energy levels shift when a perturbation is applied to a \nsystem.\n0\nL/2\nL\nx\nV0\nV(x)\n(a)\n(b)\n\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003\n0\n0.5\n1.0\nV0/E1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n\u0012E/E1\n\r\nFIGURE 10.1 (a) Asymmetric square well and (b) energy shift of the ground state \nas a function of the perturbation V0, where the points are from the exact calculation in \nSection 5.9, and the straight line is from the perturbation calculation in Example 10.2.\n"

These additional energy lev-\nels arise from a variety of perturbations to the zeroth-order Coulomb interaction Hamiltonian. In this \nchapter, we focus on the hyper\ufb01ne structure, so named because its effects are smaller than another \neffect called the \ufb01ne structure. Studying hyper\ufb01ne structure in the hydrogen atom gives us a chance to \nuse perturbation theory to calculate an important energy and also gives us a chance to learn some new \nangular momentum tools. In Example 10.4, we found that we could have solved the problem more \neasily if we had chosen the \u201ccorrect\u201d basis at the start of the problem. The \u201ccorrect\u201d basis is not so \nmuch correct as it is convenient because the perturbation Hamiltonian is already diagonal in that basis \nand we avoid the tedious diagonalization required by degenerate perturbation theory. The hyper\ufb01ne \nstructure calculation presents us with a similar scenario, but not yet knowing how to choose the most \nconvenient basis, we will solve the hyper\ufb01ne problem by brute force in the \u201cinconvenient\u201d basis and \nthen analyze the results to learn how to choose bases. The two bases for the hyper\ufb01ne problem are the \nuncoupled and coupled bases, which refer to the coupling or addition of angular momenta. The \ntheory of the addition of angular momenta complements perturbation theory to allow us to more easily \nsolve for the many rich details in the hydrogen atom, which we will continue in the next chapter.\n11.1 \u0002 HYPERFINE INTERACTION\nThe hyper\ufb01ne interaction between the electron and the nucleus arises from higher electromagnetic \nmultipole moments of the nucleus, beyond the electric monopole moment (i.e., charge) that is already \nincluded in the Coulomb interaction. The dominant hyper\ufb01ne effect is due to the magnetic moment of \nthe nucleus and its interaction with the internal magnetic \ufb01elds in the atom caused by the electron\u2019s \norbital motion and by the electron\u2019s spin magnetic moment. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the \nelectron associated with its spin is\n \nMe = -ge e\n2me\n S = -ge\n mB S\nU , \n(11.1)\nwhere the gyromagnetic ratio ge is approximately 2 and the Bohr magneton is mB = e U>2me.

State of the art techniques \nnow permit the energy levels of the hydrogen atom to be measured with 15 digits of precision, provid-\ning one of the best testing grounds for quantum theory.\nIn Chapter 10, we studied the Stark effect\u2014the perturbation of hydrogen energy levels by an \nexternal electric \ufb01eld. In Chapter 11, we studied the hyper\ufb01ne interaction\u2014the perturbation of hydro-\ngen energy levels by the magnetic interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spin. In this \nchapter we study further magnetic perturbations\u2014due to both external and internal magnetic \ufb01elds. \nThe internal \ufb01elds give rise to the \ufb01ne structure of the hydrogen energy levels and to the hyper\ufb01ne \nstructure that we have already studied. The external \ufb01elds give rise to the Zeeman effect\u2014the mag-\nnetic analog to the Stark effect. We also study internal perturbations due to relativistic effects, which \nare part of the \ufb01ne structure. We treat all of these effects as small perturbations to the hydrogen energy \nlevels we found in Chapter 8.

This is to be expected because the state \n@\n c S\ncov9 is a gerade state and the state @\n c A\ncov9 is an ungerade state. But now for the H2 molecule, these states \nare also linked to the exchange symmetry and hence the spin. Following the argument for the hydrogen \nion, we conclude that the symmetric spatial state (singlet spin state) has a lower energy than the antisym-\nmetric spatial state (triplet spin state) because of the increased electron-proton Coulomb attraction in the \ngerade state. Note that this ordering of the singlet and triplet states is opposite the case for the excited \nstates of helium. In that case, the increased overlap of the electrons in the symmetric spatial state led to an \nincreased Coulomb repulsion of the two electrons and a higher energy for the spin singlet state.\nSUMMARY\nFor a proper quantum mechanical description of multiple-particle systems, we must account for the indis-\ntinguishability of fundamental particles. The symmetrization postulate requires that the quantum state \nvector of a system of identical particles be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to exchange of \nany pair of identical particles within the system. Nature dictates that integer spin particles\u2014bosons\u2014have \nsymmetric states, while half-integer spin particles\u2014fermions\u2014have antisymmetric states. The symme-\ntrization postulate applies to the complete quantum state vector, including both the spin and space \nparts of the system.

In those examples, the Hamiltonian \nwas not time dependent, so the perturbed energy levels were still stationary states of the system. Now \nwe turn to the problem of understanding how a system responds to changes in the Hamiltonian that are \na function of time. We will \ufb01nd that the new perturbed energy states are no longer stationary states and \nthat changes or transitions between states can occur. In Chapter 3, we solved the time-dependent case \nexactly for a sinusoidal perturbation of the two-level spin system. We found that spin \ufb02ips or transi-\ntions between spin up and down states occur when the frequency of the time dependence is close to the \nBohr frequency characterizing the energy splitting of the two states. This resonance condition is also \nan important idea in this chapter.\nThe transitions between energy states that arise from a time-dependent Hamiltonian play a major \nrole in experimental studies of quantum mechanical systems. We have referred many times to spec-\ntroscopic experiments that provide evidence of the energies of quantum systems. These spectroscopic \nexperiments rely on the interaction between the oscillating electromagnetic \ufb01elds of laser beams and \natoms or molecules that respond to these time-dependent \ufb01elds. The examples in this chapter will help \nus better understand these light-matter interactions.\n14.1 \u0002 TRANSITION PROBABILITY\nThe typical experiment that we wish to model with time-dependent perturbation theory is the fol-\nlowing: we start with a system in a particular initial quantum state 0 i9, we turn on a perturbing Ham-\niltonian H\u00041t2 at time t = 0, and then we measure the probability that the system is in a new \ufb01nal \nquantum state 0  f 9 at a later time. For example, a hydrogen atom in its ground state 0 1s9 is perturbed \nby an incident laser beam, and we wish to know the probability of the atom making a transition to \nthe 0 3p9 excited state. The Hamiltonian is assumed to be H0 before the perturbation, and as in time-\nindependent perturbation theory, we assume that we know the solutions to the unperturbed energy \neigenvalue equation:\n \nH00 n9 = En0 n9."

For atom-light interactions, the atom acts as an \nef\ufb01cient antenna, despite its small size.\n14.4 \u0002 SELECTION RULES\nThe Einstein A and B coef\ufb01cients depend upon the matrix element 8 f 0 e\nn~r0 i9 from the electric dipole \ninteraction between the two states. If this matrix element is zero for some reason, then there is no \nprobability that the transition between the states will occur. There are some general guidelines as to \nwhen such matrix elements are expected to be zero, and we call these selection rules. Transitions \nfor which the matrix element is zero are therefore not allowed and are called forbidden transitions. \nHowever, recall that we are working within the electric dipole approximation, which means that we \nhave neglected magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and higher multipole interactions. It may happen \nthat a transition is forbidden within the electric dipole approximation but is allowed by a higher-order \nmultipole interaction. The higher-order interactions typically have transition rates that are reduced by \nan extra order of the \ufb01ne structure constant \u0017."

The Kronig-Penney model, on the \nother hand, simply solves the eigenvalue equation for the exact periodic potential. It is a more \u201ccor-\nrect\u201d approach, but lacks the intuitive connections to the atomic system. Moreover, in a real solid, the \nexact periodic potential is unknown, but the electronic energy levels and wave functions of atoms are \nnot too dif\ufb01cult to calculate, so the LCAO model can be a good starting point.

On the other hand, if the transition is indirect, the electron\u2019s momentum changes by a signi\ufb01cant \nfraction of the Brillouin zone width, and the photon cannot supply the needed momentum. The neces-\nsary momentum comes from another lattice denizen, the phonon, or lattice vibration. In other words, \nthe lattice changes its mode of vibration to accommodate the electron transition. In probabilistic terms, \nit means that three entities must be present at the same place and time (the electron, the photon and the \nphonon), and this is a far less likely occurrence than a coincidence of just two particles, an electron \nand a photon. The upshot is that direct transitions are far more likely than indirect transitions.\nNow the phonon supplies the necessary momentum for an indirect transition, but it also brings \nalong some energy. However, the phonon energies are rather small compared to the gap energy, so one \nphonon alone is not suf\ufb01cient to allow an electron to make an interband transition. As a \ufb01rst approxi-\nmation, it is the photon that provides the energy and the phonon that provides the momentum for an \nelectron transition across an indirect band gap.\nSi is an example of an indirect-gap semiconductor. You can see in Fig. 15.2 that the valence band \nmaximum occurs at the k-point labeled \u000f, while the conduction band minimum occurs at the k point on \nthe line between \u000f and X.

Atoms in optical molasses can be cooled to a temperature of approximately\n100 mK, which provides a sample of atoms that is easily con\ufb01ned in a magnetic trap. This temperature \nlimit, called the Doppler cooling limit, arises from the balance between the cooling force and heat-\ning caused by the random nature of spontaneous emission. The development of these laser cooling \ntechniques resulted in the Nobel Prize for physics in 1997. Laser cooling has been used to improve the \nprecision of atomic clocks, to make precision measurements of gravity, and to create sources of atoms \nthat behave as quantum mechanical waves rather than classical particles. Laser cooling and magnetic \ntrapping were combined in the discovery of Bose-Einstein condensation, which was recognized by the \nNobel Prize for physics in 2001.\n16.2 \u0002 QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING\nOur second example of a modern application of quantum mechanics is quantum information \n \nprocessing. We live in the information age. Computers, smart phones, personal digital assistants, GPS \ndevices, and more surround us, whether we want them or not. The explosion of information process-\ning systems has been enabled by the continuing miniaturization of electronic circuits. Every year, \nengineers are able to put more circuits on computer chips. Now that we have entered the nanotechnol-\nogy phase of the information revolution, we are approaching the physical limitation presented by the \natoms that make up the devices. Extrapolation of the miniaturization march would soon have us using \nindividual atoms as memory devices and circuit elements. As we approach the physical size limita-\ntion of the atoms themselves, quantum mechanics must play a role in building and using information \nprocessing devices. This shift is sure to be a disruptive in\ufb02uence in computing, but it also represents \nan opportunity to take advantage of unique quantum mechanical aspects of information processing.\nThe idea that quantum mechanics could be useful in computing stems in part from a talk and a \npaper by Richard Feynman in the early 1980\u2019s. Feynman asked the question: Can a classical computer \nreliably model a quantum mechanical system? Imagine that we want to model the quantum mechani-\ncal time evolution of a system of 50 spin-1/2 particles. The Hilbert space of this 50-particle system has \n250 states, so the quantum state vector of the system requires 250 \u0005 1015 coef\ufb01cients to describe a gen-\neral state in the Hilbert space of this system (more details on the numerics later)."

For example, if we build a system with 2 qubits, labeled A and B, then the basis states of \nthis system are the uncoupled basis states we used in Chapter 11:\n \n 0 009 = 0 09A0 09B\n \n 0 019 = 0 09A0 19B\n \n 0109 = 0 19A0 09B\n \n 0119 = 0 19A0 19B. \n(16.21)\nIn this 2-qubit system, a general superposition state is \n \n0 c9 = c000 009 + c010\n 019 + c100109 + c110119. \n(16.22)\nThis single 2-qubit state contains 22 = 4 pieces of information\u2014the cij coef\ufb01cients.

The classical N-bit system does have 2N possible states, but \nany single state contains just N pieces of information.\nThough the N-qubit superposition state contains 2N pieces of information, it is not possible to mea-\nsure it all. When we measure the state of the system, we destroy much of the information by collapsing \nthe system state vector onto the measured state. For example, if we measure the spin components of \nthe two particles described by Eq. (16.22), we learn which one of the four basis states the system is \nin, just as we would for a classical 2-bit system. Even though there are 2N pieces of information in an \nN-qubit system, it turns out that we can extract only N pieces of classical information through our mea-\nsurements. You might ask whether we can call it information if we cannot know it! This question has \nspawned research into quantum information and how it differs from classical information. The trick of \nquantum computing is to harness the vast store of information that resides in the superposition state, \nbut is hidden from direct measurement. A number of algorithms have been discovered that access the \nhidden quantum information by performing operations that affect many or all of the qubits at once. By \nperforming these multiple operations simultaneously, we achieve quantum parallelism. You can also \nperform parallel computing with classical computers, but you do so by buying more computers!\nEntangled states\nThe power of quantum parallelism relies on the phenomenon of quantum entanglement that we intro-\nduced in Chapter 4. We learned there that entangled quantum states are responsible for the \u201cspooki-\nness\u201d of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. The EPR state 0 c9 =\n1\n12 1 0  +910  -92 - 0  -910  +922 of \nEq. (4.1) is entangled because measurements on one spin are perfectly anti-correlated with measure-\nments on the other spin.

Measuring one of the qubits affects the other, possibly dis-\ntant, qubit instantaneously. Rather than regarding these nonlocal correlations as spooky, we can use \nthem as a resource in quantum information processing. The nonlocal aspect of entangled states is \nuseful because we can act on one part of a system and control another part of the system, and we can \nmeasure one part to learn about another part or about the system as a whole. This is how quantum \nalgorithms are able to process the 2N pieces of information hidden in an N-qubit system. To be useful, \nthe quantum algorithms must be cleverly designed so that the answer we want is contained within the \nN pieces of classical information available through measurements on the system. It is no use having \nmore information available if we cannot access it after the calculation.\nThe importance of entangled states is also evident in our argument about the exponential increase \nin information content of a quantum superposition state. We said that the 2-qubit superposition state \n0\n c9 in Eq. (16.22) contains 22 = 4 pieces of information and that an N-qubit superposition contains \n2N pieces of information. However, there is a caveat to that statement. It turns out that there are some \nsuperposition states that have less information content because they can be expressed as a product of \n1-qubit states. An example of such a 2-qubit product state is\n \n0 c9 = 1a00 09A + a10 19A21b00 09B + b10 19B2. \n(16.24)\nProduct states do not exhibit correlations in measurement and, therefore, they are not entangled states; \nthey behave more like classical states.

For a general N-qubit system, a superposition state that is \na product state and so is not entangled contains 2 * N pieces of information. Unfortunately, for the \n2-qubit examples we have chosen, 22 = 4 and 2 * 2 = 4 are the same, so the difference between the \n2N exponential information content of general superposition states (which includes entangled states) \nand the 2 * N linear information content of non-entangled states is not immediately evident. We\u2019ll \nleave it to you to explore the N = 3 case in Problem 16.8 and distinguish the difference. The take-\nhome message is that access to the power of quantum parallelism requires the use of entangled states.\nQuantum computing algorithms are designed to process the hidden information in the large Hilbert \nspace in a way that the desired result is brought out in the measured qubits. Two of the most impres-\nsive quantum algorithms are Shor\u2019s factorization algorithm and Grover\u2019s search algorithm. Factoring \na large number into its two prime factors is a dif\ufb01cult task for a classical computer. In 1994, Peter Shor \ndeveloped a quantum algorithm that \ufb01nds the prime factors of an integer in a time that is faster than a \nclassical computer by a factor that is exponential in the number of digits of the number being factored. \nBecause of the importance of factoring in encryption, Shor\u2019s algorithm has inspired many to try to build \na quantum computer. Grover\u2019s search algorithm allows a quantum computer to search an unsorted data-\nbase of N entries in a time proportional to 1N, compared to a classical computer that requires a time that \nis proportional to N. Details of these algorithms are available in the resources at the end of the chapter.\nQuantum algorithms are not immune to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. If we run \nthe same program twice on a quantum computer, then we might get two different answers. The power \nof quantum computing is that it can produce answers in many fewer steps than a classical computer. As \nlong as we can easily con\ufb01rm the answers on a classical computer, then the time advantage overcomes the \nneed to run the program many times. For example, as hard as it is to \ufb01nd prime factors of a large number, \nit is trivial to check whether the product of the two proposed factors do in fact yield the original number. \nLikewise, as hard as it is to \ufb01nd a needle in a haystack, it is simple to determine if the object you \ufb01nd is a \nneedle, so con\ufb01rming the result of a quantum search algorithm is straightforward on a classical computer.\n"

Complex numbers are an extension of the real numbers to include an additional \nimaginary part. The imaginary number i is the square root of \u20131:\n \ni = 2-1. \n(B.1)\nA complex number has a real part and imaginary part and is written as\n \nz = a + ib, \n(B.2)\nwhere this form assumes that a and b are real values. We refer to a as the real part of z and b as the \nimaginary part of z, and denote them as\n \n \na = Re 1z2  \n \n \nb = Im 1z2. \n \n(B.3)\nWhen we add two complex numbers together, we must keep the real and imaginary parts separate:\n \nz1 + z2 = 1a1 + ib12 + 1a2 + ib22 = 1a1 + a22 + i1b1 + b22. \n(B.4)\nThis makes it clear that the real and imaginary parts are the \u201capples and oranges\u201d that you are often \ntold not to mix together. In fact, a complex number contains two independent pieces of information, \nmuch like the components of a vector. We even represent a complex number in a similar way, as \nshown in Fig. B.1.\nVisualization of complex numbers in this \u201ccomplex plane\u201d can be very powerful. The horizontal \naxis in Fig. B.1 corresponds to the real part of a complex number and the vertical axis corresponds to \nthe imaginary part. Expressing the complex number as z = a + ib corresponds to using the Cartesian \nrepresentation. Figure B.1 also suggests that a polar representation is useful and that the radius r and \nthe angle u could also characterize a complex number.\nHow do we connect the Cartesian and polar representations mathematically? Consider the expo-\nnential of a complex number. The Taylor series expansion of a complex exponential is\n \neiu = 1 + 1iu2 + 1\n2!\n 1iu2\n2 + 1\n3!\n 1iu2\n3 + 1\n4!\n 1iu2\n4 + 1\n5!\n 1iu2\n5 + ..."
