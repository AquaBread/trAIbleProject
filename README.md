# Traible
## About
The troubleshooting bible or Traible is both a product and a service. The product is a software that contains all the data
from both past experiences and troubleshooting flowmaps found in all manuals specific to the company using it. Traible is
essentially a troubleshooting search engine that uses AI, data mining and basic keyword search to develop a company
specific solution(s) to any process upsets and/or mechanical/electrical breakdowns. It's purpose is to close the gap on
training and make past information feasibly accessible. The service comes into play when we send a tech that is
trained to put the data into the software efficiently. They are also obligated to make sure the company does not
experience any issues with the software as far as bugs or error messages when searching an answer to a common
issue.

## Purpose
We are Traible's, a software company focused on bridging all your communication gaps with the touch of a few fingers! We understand that your company has a vast amount of important knowledge necessary for training, troubleshooting and thoughts. However, these various facets can get lost or gained with a tremendous amount of time. Time that is immensely more valuable if invested in other areas of the company. We aim to fix that. Our program is the most user-friendly database for storing and exploring all your information, including but not limited to processes, formulas, important documents and so much more! All of this is with the intent to bridge all communication gaps. 

## Operations/Functions/Use
Operations - Traible is a software package that encompasses a user-friendly search engine (similar to how the Google search engine looks). An employee and/or individual would access the software
that he downloaded to his computer and type in any issues that he may be experiencing. Once he is
finished typing, (much like a search engine) the employee will hit enter and company-specific
solution(s) will appear for them to use in resolving the issue they are experiencing.

Function: The function of this invention is to close all gaps that are found in communication and/or
training. Many companies are not able to provide suitable training due to information that is not
shared but experienced. We want to take all the experiential knowledge and put it into software that
makes it accessible to newer employees that are onboarding.

Use: It can be used in all settings, including university settings. The goal is to erase the days of
having tribal knowledge from tedious experiences to help with learning a certain system and instead
make this genuine information more accessible to all individuals in their respective fields.
